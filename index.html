      <h1>Sports Conditioning</h1>
<p>As athletes mature with their chosen sports, they often lack physical and psychological foundations for success in their field.</p>
<p>Every athlete and the sport they choose can be different, making each approach a unique challenge to achieve the best. The multifaceted approach focuses on managing overall health of the athlete. Together, let's tackle the mental, physical, emotional, nutritional, sleep and environmental challenges and achieve greatness.</p>
 
<h2>What happens</h2> 
<p>We constantly change physically and mentally. The younger we are, the more easily we are able to adapt.</p> 
<p>To achieve the best of our ability, we need to tempt the body to reach its maximum capability. Athletes will always face complications along the way, moreso if they aren&#39;t conscious of the impending bodily changes. And if not dealt with, the developmental conditions will continue to be a hindrance.</p>
 
<p>Considerations are;
    <ul>
        <li>biological</li>
        <li>numerical, and</li> 
        <li>training age</li>
    </ul>   
 
<h2>What does the science say</h2>
<p>To grow in strength we need to prepare our nervous system by recruiting muscle fibers in order to create an adaptation for neuromuscular growth. This is a long phase and has constant altering due to growth changes. The aim is to have so many wired pathways which don&#39;t require a lot of thinking, so that we can save the mental energy for problem solving under pressure. This happens with the practice of fundamental movemnt patterns and techniques.</p>
 
<p>Ultimately, <a href="https://www.essa.org.au/">Exercise Sport Science Australia</a> promotes general overall development with little emphasis on sport specialisation to reduce sport burn&#45;out at an early age, limit injury and to encourage other aspects of development in a child, such as cognition.   </p> 
 
<h2>Why I am coaching</h2>
<p>To help the future of sports in Australia, we must help all types of people, late or early bloomers and those who just want to be social and have fun. I want to create a community where sport is much more enjoyable when you are kicking your goals and having fun with all types of people.</p>
