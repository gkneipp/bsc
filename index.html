      <h1>Sports Conditioning</h1>
<p>As athletes mature into their sports, a lot of the time, they lack physical and psychological foundations for success in their field. Each athlete and sport they play are different, making each approach unique to achieve the best out of the athlete. The multifaceted 'balance' approach focuses on managing the overall health of the athlete (mental, physical, emotional, nutritional, sleep and environmental). Understanding each one of their places and respecting that sometimes one factor might be more important at a given time. </p>
 
<h2>Philosophy</h2> 
<p>I believe in synergy between the body and mind allowing positivity in your raw nature be expressed to the best of its ability. By harnessing the capabilities of the mind we can dare to achieve the impossible. Allowing success in a driven form takes time, discipline and a learned personality. Motor skills are easily trained to some extent, but what is not easily trained are the values of consistency, discipline, initiative, dedication and passion. All which can be lost with a single thought. My aim is to teach my clients the tools they need for success and help them manage their sporting goals.</p>

<p>Its normal for young athletes to think that more training = a better outcome, and this can sometimes lead to overtraining and other complications. But in fact, 'less = more'. 'Less now' means 'more for later'. By understanding and listening to your body, you can manage your training load and continuously grow at a rapid rate in more than 1 mode of training.</p>  

<h2>The science behind it all</h2>

<h3>What happens</h3>
<p>When we grow, we change physically and mentally. The younger we are, the more easily we are able to adapt to change due to our exposure. Expecting that all exposure to be good is incorrect.</p>
<p>To achieve the best out of our ability we need to prepare the body for its maximum capability. Athletes can come across complications in development if they don’t know how to consider the changes. And if not dealt with, the developmental conditions could play a role into further adulthood.</p>
<p>An example of some considerations are biological, numerical and training age.</p>

<h3>What does the science say?</h3>
<p>To grow in strength we need to prepare our nervous system by recruiting muscle fibers in order to create an adaptation for neuromuscular growth. This is a long phase and has constant altering due to growth changes. The aim is to have so many wired pathways which don’t require a lot of thinking, so that we can save the mental energy for problem solving under pressure. This happens with the practice of fundamental movemnt patterns and techniques.</p>
<p>Ultimately <a href="https://www.essa.org.au/">Exercise Sport Science Australia (ESSA)</a> promotes a general overall development with little emphasis on sport specialisation to reduce sport burn-out at an early age, limit injury and to encourage other aspects of development in a child, such as cognition.</p>
