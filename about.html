<h2>Theveshran (Tv) Moodley</h2>
<p>I am a Physiotherapy student who grew up passionately playing soccer and wants to help others around performance in sport. I've played an array of sports including rugby, cricket, swimming, table tennis and many more. I love learning new things and have moved across industries from playing soccer, property management, barista competitions to studying and becoming an S&C coach. I spend my spare time doing exercise, analysing sports for fun and trying new things.</p>

<h2>Why I am coaching</h2>
<p>To help the future of sports in Australia, we must help all types of people, late/early bloomers and those who want to have fun. I want to create a community where sport is much more enjoyable when you are kicking your goals and having fun with all types of people.</p>
<p>I've played at a high level in soccer for multiple years growing up and have found myself valuing the longevity of playing the sport I love. So now everyday I go to work and have fun with exercise. </p>
