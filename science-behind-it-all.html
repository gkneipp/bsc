    <h2>What happens</h2>
    <p>When we grow, we change physically and mentally. The younger we are, the more easily we are able to adapt to change due to our exposure. Expecting that all exposure to be good is incorrect.</p>
    <p>To achieve the best out of our ability we need to prepare the body for its maximum capability. Athletes can come across complications in development if they don&#39;t know how to consider the changes. And if not dealt with, the developmental conditions could play a role into further adulthood.</p>
    <p>An example of some considerations are biological, numerical and training age.</p>
    
    <h2>What does the science say?</h2>
    <p>To grow in strength we need to prepare our nervous system by recruiting muscle fibers in order to create an adaptation for neuromuscular growth. This is a long phase and has constant altering due to growth changes. The aim is to have so many wired pathways which don&#39;t require a lot of thinking, so that we can save the mental energy for problem solving under pressure. This happens with the practice of fundamental movemnt patterns and techniques.</p>
    <p>Ultimately <a href="https://www.essa.org.au/">Exercise Sport Science Australia (ESSA)</a> promotes a general overall development with little emphasis on sport specialisation to reduce sport burn-out at an early age, limit injury and to encourage other aspects of development in a child, such as cognition.</p>
